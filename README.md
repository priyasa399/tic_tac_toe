# tic_tac_toe game
This project aims to develop a tic-tac-toe game using Flutter. It is a 2-player game, played over a 3x3 board. Players take turns, putting marks on the board. One player chooses 'X' and the other player gets 'O'. The goal is to get 3 similar symbols (X or O) along the same line - horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The person, who obtains it the earliest, is the winner. In case none of the players are able to satisfy the above conditions, it results in a draw.
